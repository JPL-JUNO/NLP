\section{Natural language vs. programming language}
\begin{definition}[Natural language processing]
    Natural language processing is an area of research in computer science and artificial intelligence (AI) concerned with processing natural languages such as English or Mandarin. This processing generally involves
    translating natural language into data (numbers) that a computer can use to
    learn about the world. And this understanding of the world is sometimes used
    to generate natural language text that reflects that understanding.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Natural language processing system]
    A natural language processing system is often referred to as a
    pipeline because it usually involves several stages of processing where natural
    language flows in one end and the processed output flows out the other.
